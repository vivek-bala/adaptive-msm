# ==============================================================================
#
class Component(mp.Process):
    """
    This class provides the basic structure for any RP component which operates
    on stateful units.  It provides means to:

      - define input channels on which to receive new units in certain states
      - define work methods which operate on the units to advance their state
      - define output channels to which to send the units after working on them
      - define notification channels over which messages with other components
        can be exchanged (publish/subscriber channels)

    All low level communication is handled by the base class -- deriving classes
    need only to declare the respective channels, valid state transitions, and
    work methods.  When a unit is received, the component is assumed to have
    full ownership over it, and that no other unit will change the unit state
    during that time.

    The main event loop of the component -- run() -- is executed as a separate
    process.  Components inheriting this class should be fully self sufficient,
    and should specifically attempt not to use shared resources.  That will
    ensure that multiple instances of the component can coexist, for higher
    overall system throughput.  Should access to shared resources be necessary,
    it will require some locking mechanism across process boundaries.

    This approach should ensure that

      - units are always in a well defined state;
      - components are simple and focus on the semantics of unit state
        progression;
      - no state races can occur on unit state progression;
      - only valid state transitions can be enacted (given correct declaration
        of the component's semantics);
      - the overall system is performant and scalable.

    Inheriting classes may overload the methods:

        initialize
        initialize_child
        finalize
        finalize_child

    These method should be used to
      - set up the component state for operation
      - declare input/output/notification channels
      - declare work methods
      - declare callbacks to be invoked on state notification
      - tear down the same on closing

    Inheriting classes MUST call the constructor:

        class StagingComponent(ComponentBase):
            def __init__(self, args):
                ComponentBase.__init__(self)

    Further, the class must implement the declared work methods, with
    a signature of:

        work(self, unit)

    The method is expected to change the unit state.  Units will not be pushed
    to outgoing channels automatically -- to do so, the work method has to call

        self.advance(unit)

    Until that method is called, the component is considered the sole owner of
    the unit.  After that method is called, the unit is considered disowned by
    the component.  It is the component's responsibility to call that method
    exactly once per unit.

    Having said that, components can return from the work methods without
    calling advance, for two reasons.

      - the unit may be in a final state, and is dropping out of the system (it
        will never again advance in the state model)
      - the component keeps ownership of the unit to advance it asynchronously
        at a later point in time.

    That implies that a component can collect ownership over an arbitrary number
    of units over time.  Either way, at most one work method instance will ever
    be active at any point in time.

        the initialize_child() method.  Initialization for component input,
