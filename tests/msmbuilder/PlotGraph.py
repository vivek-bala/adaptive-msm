    Inputs:
    Matrix -- a sparse matrix.
    EqPops -- state equilibrium populations.

    Keyword Arguments:
    Directed -- Is the graph directed?  Default: True
    EdgeScale -- a scale factor for edges.  Default: 2
    PopCutoff -- hide states with populations lower than this.  Default: 0.01
    EdgeCutoff -- hide edges with weights lower than this.  Default: 0.1
    ImageList -- A list of filenames for visualization on each states.  Default: None
    Labels -- A List of labels for display on each state.  Default: None

    Notes:
    The NetworkX graph can be used for simple visualization (e.g. matplotlib) or export to a GraphViz dotfile.
    You can optionally add image paths to the graph, which will be recorded in the dotfile for eventual visualization.
